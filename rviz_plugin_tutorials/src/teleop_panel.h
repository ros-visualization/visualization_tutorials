// Here we declare our new subclass of rviz_common::Panel.  Every panel which
// can be added via the Panels/Add_New_Panel menu is a subclass of
// rviz_common::Panel.
//
// TeleopPanel will show a text-entry field to set the output topic
// and a 2D control area.  The 2D control area is implemented by the
// DriveWidget class, and is described there.

// the Q_OBJECT macro.

  // QWidget subclass constructors usually take a parent widget
  // parameter (which usually defaults to 0).  At the same time,
  // pluginlib::ClassLoader creates instances by calling the default
  // constructor (with no arguments).  Taking the parameter and giving
  // a default of 0 lets the default constructor work and also lets
  // someone using the class for something else to pass in a parent
  // widget as they normally would with Qt.
