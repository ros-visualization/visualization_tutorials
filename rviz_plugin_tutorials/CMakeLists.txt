## BEGIN_TUTORIAL
## This CMakeLists.txt file for rviz_plugin_tutorials builds both the
## TeleopPanel tutorial and the ImuDisplay tutorial.
##
## First start with some standard catkin stuff.

set(CMAKE_AUTOMOC ON)

## This plugin includes Qt widgets, so we must include Qt.
## We'll use the version that rviz used so they are compatible.

  set(QT_LIBRARIES Qt5::Widgets)

## I prefer the Qt signals and slots to avoid defining "emit", "slots",
## etc because they can conflict with boost signals, so define QT_NO_KEYWORDS here.
add_definitions(-DQT_NO_KEYWORDS)

## Here we specify the list of source files.
## The generated MOC files are included automatically as headers.

## An rviz plugin is just a shared library, so here we declare the
## library to be called ``${PROJECT_NAME}`` (which is
## "rviz_plugin_tutorials", or whatever your version of this project
## is called) and specify the list of source files we collected above
## in ``${SRC_FILES}``.
add_library(${PROJECT_NAME} ${SRC_FILES})

## Link the myviz executable with whatever Qt libraries have been defined by
## the ``find_package(Qt4 ...)`` line above, or by the
## ``set(QT_LIBRARIES Qt5::Widgets)``, and with whatever libraries
## catkin has included.
##
## Although this puts "rviz_plugin_tutorials" (or whatever you have
## called the project) as the name of the library, cmake knows it is a
## library and names the actual file something like
## "librviz_plugin_tutorials.so", or whatever is appropriate for your
## particular OS.
